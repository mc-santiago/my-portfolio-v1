            <h2>
                My life before web development
            </h2>

            <p>Marketing, teaching English and general business administration were some of the fields I delved into before going into web development. 
                In fact, one of my degrees is just that, a bachelor's degree in Business Administration, majoring in Marketing. 
                My work experience in that field are things like market research, event organization and some advertising.  
            </p>
            <p>As part of my Masters degree in International Business I was fortunate enough to do the Jos√© M. Berrocal Institute of Economics and Finance 
                internship at the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico. Here I worked with international investment law and prepared a report 
                detailing the effects on Puerto Rico of the 2008 Financial Crisis, 
               I also updated the Government's "Guide to Doing Business in Puerto Rico".
            </p>
            <p>
                Since moving to Spain I have taught English as a second language in Zaragoza and in Madrid. I also did a year of project management, 
                which complimented and built upon my event management experience from back in Puerto Rico.
