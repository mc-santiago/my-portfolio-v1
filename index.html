            <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Maria del Carmen Santiago</strong>, and I am a Madrid-based <em>junior web developer</em>.
                In the last few months I have been building up my skills as a full-stack developer by completing a bootcamp and my own projects.
            </p>
            <p>I would say that my front-end skills are stronger right now, but I have worked
                with back-end development as well and am not afraid to learn more about either. Go to  
                'Projects' to have a peak into some of my work. I also invite you to visit my github 
                page at <a href='https://github.com/mc-santiago/' target="_blank" >github.com/mc-santiago/</a> to see more.
            </p>

            What has been my web-dev educational journey like this year?
        </h2>
        <p>Well, I started learning about <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>. 
        Easy enough... then came <b>javascript</b>. Not as easy, but so much more fun!
        After javascript came the part about learning about the oh so famous js frameworks.
        I started with <b>React</b> and <b>VUE</b>. 
        I have been doing most of my projects with ReactJS, but after taking a workshop and 
        building my first VUE project I got to say I am glad I started with the hardest of the two to understand!</p>

            My life before web development
        </h2>
        <p>Marketing, teaching English and general business administration where some of the fields I delved in before going into web development. 
            In fact, one of my degree's is just that, bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing. 
            I know I studied marketing, but like many of my collegues, I disliked sales so I never really went into that. 
            What I did do in that field where things like market research, organize events and some advertising.
